This is a small demo site built using Wax and Jekyll. [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) is an open source framework for the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static-site generator that contains a website theme and a set of automated tasks. These can be used to make a static website from a folder of images and a spreadsheet of item metadata. The theme can be configured to suit the needs of a particular project. Wax supports high-quality image collections and scholarly exhibits focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility.

For testing purposes, I've added two photos, two poems, and two multi-page letters from Cardiff University's [Edward Thomas archive](https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/data/gb1239-424), with their metadata. Images were loaded as high resolution jpegs, and converted by the wax:derivatives task into IIIF tiled images, which can be viewed in an OpenSeaDragon viewer. 

The images can be filtered via the homepage (see below), or via the [Browse](https://aeh0.github.io/wax-demo/collection/) page. The metadata attached to the images can be keyword searched via the [Search](https://aeh0.github.io/wax-demo/search/) page - results update responsively as keywords are entered. An Exhibits collection holds sample pages featuring illustrated narratives in markdown. These support html iframes - allowing the inclusion of [pre-existing IIIF content](https://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=https://librarysearch.cardiff.ac.uk/view/iiif/presentation/44WHELF_CAR/12206143060002420/manifest?iiifVersion=2#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&xywh=-1918%2C0%2C9883%2C4031), as well as the images generated by Wax. One example demonstrates an [inline image and iframe](https://aeh0.github.io/wax-demo/exhibits/b/), while the other uses an [inline parallax image](https://aeh0.github.io/wax-demo/exhibits/a/).
